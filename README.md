## Introduction
This project aims to create a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users. The chatbot is designed to be a helpful assistant, providing information, answering questions, and assisting with various tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: [Python]
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library: [spaCy]
- Dialogue Management: [rasa]
- Web Framework: [Flask]
- Database: [Json]
- Deployment: [Streamlit], [Render]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-project.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd chatbot-project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Architecture

### High-Level Design
The chatbot system is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability. The main components include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module
- Dialogue Management
- Knowledge Base
- User Interface

### Components
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module**: This module is responsible for processing user input, understanding the intent, and extracting relevant entities.
2. **Dialogue Management**: The dialogue management component handles the conversational flow, decides on the appropriate response, and generates the output.
3. **Knowledge Base**: The knowledge base stores the information and data required for the chatbot to function, such as pre-defined responses, knowledge articles, and user profiles.
4. **User Interface**: The user interface allows users to interact with the chatbot, either through a web-based chat interface or other communication channels (e.g., messaging platforms).

## Usage

### Running the Chatbot
1. Activate the virtual environment (if not already done):
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
2. Start the chatbot server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
3. The chatbot should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Interacting with the Chatbot
You can interact with the chatbot through the web-based chat interface. Simply open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The chatbot application uses the following environment variables:
- `DB_URI`: The connection string for the database
- `API_KEY`: The API key for accessing external services (if applicable)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are implemented using the `unittest` framework. You can run the tests with the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Integration Tests
Integration tests are implemented using the `pytest` framework. You can run the tests with the following command:
```
pytest tests/integration
```

## Deployment

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
The project is set up with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline includes the following steps:
1. Code linting and formatting checks
2. Unit and integration tests
3. Building and pushing the Docker image to a registry
4. Deploying the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Streamlit, Render)

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement natural language understanding capabilities
- [ ] Integrate with external APIs for additional functionality
- [ ] Add support for multi-language conversations
- [ ] Enhance the user interface with more features
